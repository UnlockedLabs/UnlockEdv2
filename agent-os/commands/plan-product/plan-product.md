You are helping to plan and document the mission, roadmap and tech stack for the current product.  This will include:

- **Gathering Information**: The user's product vision, user personas, problems and key features
- **Mission Document**: Take what you've gathered and create a concise mission document
- **Roadmap**: Create a phased development plan with prioritized features
- **Tech stack**: Establish the technical stack used for all aspects of this product's codebase

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names.  Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

# PHASE 1: Product Concept

This begins a multi-step process for planning and documenting the mission and roadmap for the current product.

The FIRST STEP is to confirm the product details by following these instructions:

Collect comprehensive product information from the user:

```bash
# Check if product folder already exists
if [ -d "agent-os/product" ]; then
    echo "Product documentation already exists. Review existing files or start fresh?"
    # List existing product files
    ls -la agent-os/product/
fi
```

Gather from user the following required information:
- **Product Idea**: Core concept and purpose (required)
- **Key Features**: Minimum 3 features with descriptions
- **Target Users**: At least 1 user segment with use cases
- **Tech stack**: Confirmation or info regarding the product's tech stack choices

If any required information is missing, prompt user:
```
Please provide the following to create your product plan:
1. Main idea for the product
2. List of key features (minimum 3)
3. Target users and use cases (minimum 1)
4. Will this product use your usual tech stack choices or deviate in any way?
```


Then WAIT for me to give you specific instructions on how to use the information you've gathered to create the mission and roadmap.

# PHASE 2: Create Mission

Now that you've gathered information about this product, use that info to create the mission document in `agent-os/product/mission.md` by following these instructions:

Create `agent-os/product/mission.md` with comprehensive product definition following this structure for its' content:

#### Mission Structure:
```markdown
# Product Mission

## Pitch
[PRODUCT_NAME] is a [PRODUCT_TYPE] that helps [TARGET_USERS] [SOLVE_PROBLEM]
by providing [KEY_VALUE_PROPOSITION].

## Users

### Primary Customers
- [CUSTOMER_SEGMENT_1]: [DESCRIPTION]
- [CUSTOMER_SEGMENT_2]: [DESCRIPTION]

### User Personas
**[USER_TYPE]** ([AGE_RANGE])
- **Role:** [JOB_TITLE/CONTEXT]
- **Context:** [BUSINESS/PERSONAL_CONTEXT]
- **Pain Points:** [SPECIFIC_PROBLEMS]
- **Goals:** [DESIRED_OUTCOMES]

## The Problem

### [PROBLEM_TITLE]
[PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION]. [QUANTIFIABLE_IMPACT].

**Our Solution:** [SOLUTION_APPROACH]

## Differentiators

### [DIFFERENTIATOR_TITLE]
Unlike [COMPETITOR/ALTERNATIVE], we provide [SPECIFIC_ADVANTAGE].
This results in [MEASURABLE_BENEFIT].

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **[FEATURE_NAME]:** [USER_BENEFIT_DESCRIPTION]

### Collaboration Features
- **[FEATURE_NAME]:** [USER_BENEFIT_DESCRIPTION]

### Advanced Features
- **[FEATURE_NAME]:** [USER_BENEFIT_DESCRIPTION]
```

#### Important Constraints

- **Focus on user benefits** in feature descriptions, not technical details
- **Keep it concise** and easy for users to scan and get the more important concepts quickly

# PHASE 3: Create Roadmap

Now that you've created this product's mission.md, use that to guide your creation of the roadmap in `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` by following these instructions:

Generate `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` with an ordered feature checklist:

Do not include any tasks for initializing a new codebase or bootstrapping a new application. Assume the user is already inside the project's codebase and has a bare-bones application initialized.

#### Creating the Roadmap:

1. **Review the Mission** - Read `agent-os/product/mission.md` to understand the product's goals, target users, and success criteria.

2. **Identify Features** - Based on the mission, determine the list of concrete features needed to achieve the product vision.

3. **Strategic Ordering** - Order features based on:
   - Technical dependencies (foundational features first)
   - Most direct path to achieving the mission
   - Building incrementally from MVP to full product

4. **Create the Roadmap** - Use the structure below as your template. Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[FEATURE_NAME]`, `[DESCRIPTION]`, `[EFFORT]`) with real content that you create based on the mission.

#### Roadmap Structure:
```markdown
# Product Roadmap

1. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
2. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
3. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
4. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
5. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
6. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
7. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`
8. [ ] [FEATURE_NAME] — [1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION OF COMPLETE, TESTABLE FEATURE] `[EFFORT]`

> Notes
> - Order items by technical dependencies and product architecture
> - Each item should represent an end-to-end (frontend + backend) functional and testable feature
```

Effort scale:
- `XS`: 1 day
- `S`: 2-3 days
- `M`: 1 week
- `L`: 2 weeks
- `XL`: 3+ weeks

#### Important Constraints

- **Make roadmap actionable** - include effort estimates and dependencies
- **Priorities guided by mission** - When deciding on order, aim for the most direct path to achieving the mission as documented in mission.md
- **Ensure phases are achievable** - start with MVP, build incrementally

# PHASE 4: Create Tech Stack

The final part of our product planning process is to document this product's tech stack in `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`.  Follow these instructions to do so:

Create `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md` with a list of all tech stack choices that cover all aspects of this product's codebase.

### Creating the Tech Stack document

#### Step 1: Note User's Input Regarding Tech Stack

IF the user has provided specific information in the current conversation in regards to tech stack choices, these notes ALWAYS take precidence.  These must be reflected in your final `tech-stack.md` document that you will create.

#### Step 2: Gather User's Default Tech Stack Information

Reconcile and fill in the remaining gaps in the tech stack list by finding, reading and analyzing information regarding the tech stack.  Find this information in the following sources, in this order:

1. If user has provided their default tech stack under "User Standards & Preferences Compliance", READ and analyze this document.
2. If the current project has any of these files, read them to find information regarding tech stack choices for this codebase:
  - `claude.md`
  - `agents.md`

#### Step 3: Create the Tech Stack Document

Create `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md` and populate it with the final list of all technical stack choices, reconciled between the information the user has provided to you and the information found in provided sources.


## Display confirmation and next step

Once you've created tech-stack.md, output the following message:

```
✅ I have documented the product's tech stack at `agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`.

Review it to ensure all of the tech stack details are correct for this product.

You're ready to start planning a feature spec! You can do so by running `shape-spec.md` or `write-spec.md`.
```
