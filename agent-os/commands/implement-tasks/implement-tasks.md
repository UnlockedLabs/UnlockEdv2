Now that we have a spec and tasks list ready for implementation, we will proceed with implementation of this spec by following this multi-phase process:

PHASE 1: Determine which task group(s) from tasks.md should be implemented
PHASE 2: Implement the given task(s)
PHASE 3: After ALL task groups have been implemented, produce the final verification report.

Carefully read and execute the instructions in the following files IN SEQUENCE, following their numbered file names.  Only proceed to the next numbered instruction file once the previous numbered instruction has been executed.

Instructions to follow in sequence:

# PHASE 1: Determine Tasks

First, check if the user has already provided instructions about which task group(s) to implement.

**If the user HAS provided instructions:** Proceed to PHASE 2 to delegate implementation of those specified task group(s) to the **implementer** subagent.

**If the user has NOT provided instructions:**

Read `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to review the available task groups, then output the following message to the user and WAIT for their response:

```
Should we proceed with implementation of all task groups in tasks.md?

If not, then please specify which task(s) to implement.
```

# PHASE 2: Implement Tasks

Now that you have the task group(s) to be implemented, proceed with implementation by following these instructions:

Implement all tasks assigned to you and ONLY those task(s) that have been assigned to you.

## Implementation process:

1. Analyze the provided spec.md, requirements.md, and visuals (if any)
2. Analyze patterns in the codebase according to its built-in workflow
3. Implement the assigned task group according to requirements and standards
4. Update `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` to update the tasks you've implemented to mark that as done by updating their checkbox to checked state: `- [x]`

## Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed in the codebase.
- **Specific notes provided in requirements.md, spec.md AND/OR tasks.md**
- **Visuals provided (if any)** which would be located in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/planning/visuals/`
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

## Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.
  - Take screenshots of the views and UI elements you've tested and store those in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verification/screenshots/`.  Do not store screenshots anywhere else in the codebase other than this location.
  - Analyze the screenshot(s) you've taken to check them against your current requirements.


## Display confirmation and next step

Display a summary of what was implemented.

IF all tasks are now marked as done (with `- [x]`) in tasks.md, display this message to user:

```
All tasks have been implemented: `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md`.

NEXT STEP 👉 Run `3-verify-implementation.md` to verify the implementation.
```

IF there are still tasks in tasks.md that have yet to be implemented (marked unfinished with `- [ ]`) then display this message to user:

```
Would you like to proceed with implementation of the remaining tasks in tasks.md?

If not, please specify which task group(s) to implement next.
```

# PHASE 3: Verify Implementation

Now that we've implemented all tasks in tasks.md, we must run final verifications and produce a verification report using the following MULTI-PHASE workflow:

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ensure tasks.md has been updated

Check `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/tasks.md` and ensure that all tasks and their sub-tasks are marked as completed with `- [x]`.

If a task is still marked incomplete, then verify that it has in fact been completed by checking the following:
- Run a brief spot check in the code to find evidence that this task's details have been implemented
- Check for existence of an implementation report titled using this task's title in `agent-os/spec/[this-spec]/implementation/` folder.

IF you have concluded that this task has been completed, then mark it's checkbox and its' sub-tasks checkboxes as completed with `- [x]`.

IF you have concluded that this task has NOT been completed, then mark this checkbox with ⚠️ and note it's incompleteness in your verification report.


### Step 2: Update roadmap (if applicable)

Open `agent-os/product/roadmap.md` and check to see whether any item(s) match the description of the current spec that has just been implemented.  If so, then ensure that these item(s) are marked as completed by updating their checkbox(s) to `- [x]`.


### Step 3: Run entire tests suite

Run the entire tests suite for the application so that ALL tests run.  Verify how many tests are passing and how many have failed or produced errors.

Include these counts and the list of failed tests in your final verification report.

DO NOT attempt to fix any failing tests.  Just note their failures in your final verification report.


### Step 4: Create final verification report

Create your final verification report in `agent-os/specs/[this-spec]/verifications/final-verification.html`.

The content of this report should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Verification Report: [Spec Title]

**Spec:** `[spec-name]`
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ✅ Passed | ⚠️ Passed with Issues | ❌ Failed
